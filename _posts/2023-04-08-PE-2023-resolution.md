I've been thinking about getting some sort of certificate after graduated from school and been practicing engineering at working for many years. I did a quick research and it looks quite a journey to get there but i believe worth it.

According to the Texas PE board requriement, I'll need to have FE first and take the extra exam to be qualified as PE, so i guess the short term goal is pass the FE exam. I've been looking for videos about the FE exam preparation.

Mark this down so i can see how much time i actually spend on the PE process.
